I absolutely love cryptography, especially when I can visualize it beyond just the mathematical equations and numbers. While it might seem that the most prominent usages of cryptography lie in blockchain or password security, there are other fascinating applications that often go unnoticed.

One such application is [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity 'Learn more about SRI from MDN'), a feature that enhances the security of web applications in a surprisingly elegant way, which I love as a frontend engineer.

**TL;DR:** It's based on hashing data for immutability checks, preventing any form of tampering on resources when you rely on a third-party domain you do not trust.

## Introduction

If you work on the web very often, you've likely loaded resources from an external CDN, such as jQuery or Bootstrap, and noticed the <InlineCode code="integrity"/> attribute in the script and link tags?.

If not, go check out the docs of these popular tools and read the installation intructions before continuing further. It's not just specific for these packages but any resource loaded via CDN from any popular provider should have theme.

It must look familiar to the one mentioned below?

```html title="index.html" mark="integrity"
<!-- Bootstrap CSS CDN link -->
<link
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
	rel="stylesheet"
	integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH"
	crossorigin="anonymous"
/>

<!-- Bootstrap JS CDN link -->
<script
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
	integrity="sha384-0pUGZvbkm6XF6gxjEnlmuGrJXVbNuzT9qBBavbLwCsOGabYfZo0T0to5eqruptLy"
	crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

If you have ever wondered what does the <InlineCode code="integrity"/> attribute on these tags mean? then you have come to the right place.

We'll explore and dive into the integrity attributes found in script and link tags, explain how to generate these attributes, and demonstrate their usage in SRI.

## What is SRI?

In a gist, it's a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch are delivered without any unexpected manipulation (in transit or otherwise), i.e, data fetched and loaded must be **immutable** - unchanged from the original state which was argeed upon.

Immutability is essential because it guarantees that the resources your web application relies on are exactly what you expect them to be, without any unauthorized modifications that could compromise security or functionality, and funnily it is quite easy to verify that through cryptographic hashing.

**Hashing** of data simply mean generating fixed size output string for any input using a mathematical algorithm. For SRI, we need an hashing algorithm which has following properties:

1. **Deterministic**: For the same input, it must always produces the same output hash value, ensuring consistency. Usually the size of the output hash depends on the algorithm function choosen.
2. **Psuedo-random**: It is computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function to determine the original input from the hash value alone.
3. **Collision Resistent**: It is highly improbable for two different inputs to produce the same hash value.

For SRI, the most commonly used hashing functions are **SHA-256**, **SHA-384** and **SHA-512**, where 256, 384 and 512 represents the numbers of bits for the output hash.

It can be expressed as <InlineCode code="outputHash = hashFn(input);"/>
