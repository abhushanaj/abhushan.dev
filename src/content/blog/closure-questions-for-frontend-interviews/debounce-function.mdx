## What is debouncing?

**Debouncing** is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called.

## Basic debouncing function

```js
export default function debounce(func: Function, wait: number): Function {
  let timerId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null =null;

  function debouncedFnImpl(...args: Array<unknown>){
    const thisArg= this;

    if(timerId){
      clearTimeout(timerId)
    }

    timerId=setTimeout(()=>{
      timerId=null;
      func.call(thisArg, ...args);
    }, wait)
  }

  return debouncedFnImpl;
}

```
