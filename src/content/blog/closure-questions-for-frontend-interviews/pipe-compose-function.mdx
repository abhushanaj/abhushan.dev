**Pipe** and **Compose** are both higher order function inspired from functional programming languages to facilitate function composition and data transformation. They are exactly same in their behaviour with one minor difference i.e, the order in which ths transformation is performed.

{/* ======= Pipe Function ===== */}

<section>
## 1. Pipe function implementation

**Pipe** takes multiple functions as arguments and executes them sequentially, passing the output of each function as the input to the next one, which creates a linear flow of data processing.

```js
function pipe(...fns) {
	// Simply return an identity function if no function are passed to pipe
	if (!fns.length) {
		return (value) => value;
	}

	function pipeFnImpl(initialValue) {
		// since we want left to right transformations
		return fns.reduce((acc, fn) => {
			return fn(acc);
		}, initialValue);
	}

	return pipeFnImpl;
}

// Usage of pipe
function addWithTen(num) {
	return num + 10;
}

function multipleWithTen(num) {
	return num * 10;
}

function divideByFive(num) {
	return num / 5;
}

const pipedFn = pipe(addWithTen, multipleWithTen, divideByFive);

/**
 * 1st transformation: 2 + 10 = 12
 * 2nd transformation: 12 * 10 = 120
 * 3rd transfformation: 120 /5 = 24
 */
console.log(pipedFn(2)); // yields 24
```

## 2. Compose function implementation

**Compose**, on the other hand, also takes multiple functions but executes them in reverse order, where the output of the last function becomes the input of the second-to-last function, and so on, until the first function is reached.

```js
function compose(...fns) {
	// Simply return an identity function if no function are passed to compose
	if (!fns.length) {
		return (value) => value;
	}

	function composeFnImpl(initialValue) {
		// since we want right to left transformations
		return fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => {
			return fn(acc);
		}, initialValue);
	}

	return composeFnImpl;
}

// Usage of compose
function addWithTen(num) {
	return num + 10;
}

function multipleWithTen(num) {
	return num * 10;
}

function divideByFive(num) {
	return num / 5;
}

const composedFn = compose(addWithTen, multipleWithTen, divideByFive);

/**
 * 1st transformation: 2/5 = 0.4
 * 2nd transformation: 0.4 * 10 = 4
 * 3rd transformation: 4 + 10 = 14
 */
console.log(composedFn(2)); // yields 14
```
