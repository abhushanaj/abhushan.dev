Composition, in the context of software development, refers to the practice of combining simple or smaller components to create more complex and functional structures.

It is a fundamental concept that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability in code. Rather than relying on a monolithic or inheritance-based approach, where functionality is inherited from a single, possibly complex base class, composition encourages building systems by assembling smaller, self-contained components.

In the dynamic realm of software development, mastering the art of composition is the key to building scaleable, maintainable and efficient applications.

It might not seem very obvious at first, but the principle holds true even when creating user interfaces, where the complexity of modern web applications demands a thoughtful and modular approach.

Today, I'll cover the specifics of how composition in React is truly underrated and demonstrate how, unknowingly, you might be using it without understanding its benefits ðŸ˜….
