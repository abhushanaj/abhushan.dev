<InlineCode code="Object.seal()" /> static method on the Object constructor when used on objects "seal" the object. A sealed
object has a fixed set of properties: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability
and configurability cannot be changed, and its prototype cannot be re-assigned.{' '}

You can learn more about seal on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal 'Visit MDN to learn more about Object.seal()').

However, **_sealing only works on non-nested objects._**

{/* ===== Variation: Deep Seal ==== */}

<section>
<SubHeading>Variation: Deep Seal</SubHeading>

## 1. Basic implementation

We have to implement a <InlineCode code="deepSealObject" /> function which seals an object on every nested level.

We can verify whether an object is sealed or not using the <InlineCode code="Object.isSealed()" /> static method on object constructor.

```js title="./src/deepSealObject.js"
function deepSealObject(input) {
	const result = {};

	for (const key in input) {
		// only for non inherited keys
		if (Object.hasOwn(input, key)) {
			const value = input[key];

			if (typeof value !== 'object') {
				result[key] = Object.seal(value);
			} else {
				// recursively keep sealing each level
				result[key] = deepSealObject(value);
			}
		}
	}

	// finally seal the root
	return Object.seal(result);
}

// Usage
const input = {
	a: 1,
	b: {
		c: 2
	}
};

console.log(Object.isSealed(input)); // yields false

const output = deepSealObject(input);

console.log(Object.isSealed(input)); // yields true

delete output.b.c; // no effect

console.log(output);
```

<SubHeading>Variation: Deep Freeze</SubHeading>

## 2. Deep freeze implementation

We also have a <InlineCode code="Object.freeze()"/> static method available which is very similar to <InlineCode code="Object.seal()"/>. For an interview setting, one might be asked to implement <InlineCode code="deepFreezeObject"/> as well.

The implementation remains exactly same except, we use the **Object.freeze()** method instead of **Object.seal()**.

```js title="./src/deepFreezeObject.js" ins={10,13, 19}
function deepFreezeObject(input) {
	const result = {};

	for (const key in input) {
		// only for non inherited keys
		if (Object.hasOwn(input, key)) {
			const value = input[key];

			if (typeof value !== 'object') {
				result[key] = Object.freeze(value);
			} else {
				// recursively keep sealing each level
				result[key] = deepFreezeObject(value);
			}
		}
	}

	// finally seal the root
	return Object.freeze(result);
}
```

<br />

Whether to **deepFreeze** or **deepSeal** an object really depends on what type of restrictions you want imposed on the object.
It's better to understand the difference between them, so as to make the best possible decision when it comes to preventing/restricting
modifications of an object.

## Further Reading

I strongly encourage you to explore and tackle additional questions in my [Recursion Questions for Frontend Interviews](/blog/recursion-questions-for-frontend-interviews/ 'Find more question on recursion in the recursion questions for frontend interviews blog series') blog series.

By doing so, you can enhance your understanding and proficiency with recursion, preparing you to excel in your upcoming frontend interviews.

**_Wishing you best. Happy Interviewing_** ðŸ«¡.
