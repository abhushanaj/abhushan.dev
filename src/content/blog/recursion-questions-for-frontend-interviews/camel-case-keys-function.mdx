<InlineCode code="camelCase" /> is a convention used in programming and naming conventions where multiple words are combined
into one continuous string of text, with each word within the string capitalized except for the first word.

<InlineCode code="camelCase" /> conventions are followed in JavaScript codebases as well. We need to implement a camelCaseKeys
functon that can convert all keys in object to follow camelCase convention.

<section>
## 1. Basic implementation

Input can have nested objects or array of objects. Try not to mutate the original input.

```js title="./src/camelCaseKeys.js"
import camelCase from './src/utils.js';

function camelCaseKeys(input) {
	// for arrays
	if (Array.isArray(input)) {
		const outArr = [];
		input.forEach((item) => {
			outArr.push(camelCaseKeys(item));
		});
		return outArr;
	}

	// for objects
	const outObj = Object.create({});

	for (const key in input) {
		// avoid iterating over inherited keys
		if (Object.hasOwn(input, key)) {
			const value = input[key];

			if (typeof value !== 'object') {
				outObj[camelCase(key)] = value;
			} else {
				outObj[camelCase(key)] = camelCaseKeys(value);
			}
		}
	}
	return outObj;
}

// Usage

const convertedObj = camelCaseKeys({
	hello_world: true,
	hello: {
		baz_bar: [{ name: 'JS', age_in_years: 24 }]
	}
});

console.log(convertedObj);

/**
 * Yields
 * {
    "helloWorld": true,
    "hello": {
        "bazBar": [
            {
                "name": "JS",
                "ageInYears": 24
            }
        ]
    }
}
 */
```

Here the implementation of <InlineCode code="camelCase"/> is not really important. You can use any technique solution you prefer present on the internet. The goal is not to focus on utility but rather the recursion done.
