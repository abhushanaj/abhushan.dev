					I'm a <strong class="font-medium text-text-neutral-hc">Frontend Engineer</strong> with a passion for crafting web
					products that make a difference. My journey into the world of web development began as a self-taught enthusiast,

					Over the past 3 years, I've also had the remarkable opportunity to serve as a
